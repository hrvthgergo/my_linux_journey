intro:
to interpret commands bash follows the following process step-by-step, in order.

step1 - tokenization
	- during tokenization shell reads its input for unquoted metacharacters and uses them to divide the command line into words, operators and comments (#)
	- definitions:
		- a token is either a word or an operator. tokens are separated by metacharacters.
		- words: a sequence of characters treated as a unit by the shell. words may not include unquoted metacharacters.
		- operators: a control operator or a redirection operator. operators contain at least one unquoted metacharacter.
		- control operators: a token that performs a control function. it is; 
			a newline or one of the following -> ‘||’, ‘&&’, ‘&’, ‘;’, ‘;;’, ‘;&’, ‘;;&’, ‘|’, ‘|&’, ‘(’, or ‘)’.
		- redirection operators: ‘<’, ‘>’, '<<‘, '>>', '2>', '2>>', '<&’, ‘>&’, ‘>|’, '<<-’, '<>.
		- metacharacters: metacharacter: a character that, when unquoted, separates words; 
			space, tab, newline or one of the following characters: ‘|’, ‘&’, ‘;’, ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘<’, or ‘>’.
