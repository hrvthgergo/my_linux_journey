our main goal is to understand how can we interact with the system using bash shell.
to be able to reach a common understanding we have to get to know the process-and-progress, that the shell is going to follow to interpret your connection trial.
we assume that we will contact the system invoking somehowe the bash shell. to do so we have the following options to manage interactions:
	- using user's terminal,
	- reads input from a file (called shell script),
	- reads input from a string supplied as an argument to the -c invocation option of the bash command.
to interpret commands, sent in any previous forms, bash follows the following process step-by-step, in order:
	1) tokenization
	2) command identification
	3) expansions
	4) quote removal
	5) redirection
	6) execute

let see a brief summery of these steps:

---------------------
step1) - tokenization
---------------------
	- during tokenization shell reads its input for unquoted metacharacters and uses them to divide the command line into words, operators and comments(#).

-------------------------------
step2) - command identification
-------------------------------
	- during command identification shell breaks the command line down into simple and compound commands.
	- definitions:
		- simple commands: are a set of words terminated by a control operator. the first word is the command name, subsequent words are taken as individual arguments (options and their values) to that command.
		- compound commands: these are bash’s programming constructs. they start with a reserved word and are terminated by the corresponding reserved word. compound commands are the shell programming language constructs, each construct begins with a reserved word or control operator and is terminated by a corresponding reserved word or operator.
		- reserved words: words that have special meaning to the shell, used to begin and end the shell’s compound commands, link -> https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Reserved-Words.html.

-------------------
step3) - expansions
-------------------
	- expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into tokens and identified commands
	- link: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html
	- there are seven (+1) kinds of expansions. the processing order is;
		1) brace expansion
		2) tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion) (+1 process substitution);
		3) word splitting;
		4) filename expansion/globbing.
		- only brace expansion, word splitting, and filename expansion can increase the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word.
	- unfolding stories -> find examples and further details here bash_script/bash_as_programming_language.txt:
		- brace expansions -> {},
		- tilde expansion -> ~,
		- parameter and variable expansion -> $, ${},
		- arithmetic expansion -> $(()),
		- command substitution -> $(),
		- process substitution -> <(), >(),
		- word splitting: after processing the preceding expansions, the shell will try to split the results of unquoted parameter expansions, unquoted arithmetic expansions and unquoted command substitutions into individual words. mind the different word splitting result of $var and "$var".
		  ${IFS@Q} - bash will split a word using the characters stored in the IFS variable, which by default contains space, tab, and newline.
		- filename expansion/globbing: any word containing one of globbing characters is interpreted as a pattern, and replaced with a list of alphabetically-sorted filenames that match the pattern (if they exist)
			- globbing pattern characters: *, ?, [], [!]. can be extended -> shopt -s extglob.
				- symbol(pattern1 | ... | patternN) -> symbols are: ?, *. @, +, !.

----------------------
step4) - quote removal
----------------------
	- during quote removal shell removes all unquoted backslashes, single quote characters, and double quote characters that did not result from a shell expansion.
	- definitions:
		- escape character(\): preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of newline. if a \newline pair appears, and the backslash itself is not quoted, the \newline is treated as a line continuation.
		- single quotes(''): preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.a single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.
		- double quotes(""): preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of ‘$’, ‘`’, ‘\’, and, when history expansion is enabled, ‘!’.

--------------------
step5) - redirection
--------------------
	- during redirection shell processes any redirection operators to determine where the standard input, standard output and standard error data streams for the command should connect to ( not all commands use every data stream ).
	- definitions:
		- redirection operators: ‘<’, ‘>’, '<<‘, '>>', '2>', '2>>', '<&’, ‘>&’, ‘>|’, '<<-’, '<>'.

step6) - execute
