compound commands
-----------------

compound commands are bash’s programming constructs.
they start with a reserved word and are terminated by the corresponding reserved word.
compound commands are the shell programming language constructs, each construct begins with a reserved word or control operator and is terminated by a corresponding reserved word or operator.

reserved words are words that have special meaning to the shell, used to begin and end the shell’s compound commands.
e.g.: if, fi, case, esac, for, end, then, ...

User Input:
-----------

• Positional parameters: -> shell assigns numbers to each command line arg that is entered.
	- $1, $2, $3, ...
	echo "Name: $1"
	echo "Age: $2"

• Special parameters: -> created by the shell for us, unmodifiable.
	- $#: num of command line args.
	- $0: store the script name.
	- $?: returns the most recent exit code.

• The "read" command: -> asks for input from the user and saves it into a variable.
	- syntax: read [options] variable.
	- [options]:
		-p "prompt" 	-> displays instruction prompt to the user,
		-t time	        -> timeout in seconds,
		-s		        -> secret typing,
		-N chars	    -> limit to type exactly the num of chars character,
		-n chars	    -> set the limit of input characters.

• The "select" command -> provide a 'dropdown' menu/list of options to select from using the number of the option in the list.
	-syntax: 
		PS3="Please select an option:"
		select variable in options; do
			commands
			break
		done
	- list strating with 1) and counting.

• The "getopts" command -> enables bash to get options provided to the script from the command line
	- syntax:
		getopts "optstring" variable
	
	- variable called opt conventionally.
	- any single letter can be placed as optstring but command can process only one letter options.
	- "optstring" is case-sensitive.
	- unexpected options are stored as question mark(?) in the variable -> \?)command;;.
	- often used as part of a while loop.
	
	- options can accept arguments, syntax:
		getopts "a:b:c:"  opt
		
		- the provided argument is stored in the $OPTARG shell variable.
.
• The "readarray" command: -> converts the standard input stream into an array
	- syntax:
		readarray -t arrayname < file
		readarray -t arrayname < <(command1 [| command2 | ... | commandN])
	
	- "-t" option prevent any newline character from being stored in array values.

Logic:
------

• Test commands:
	- syntax: [ test-expression ]
		- test-expression operators:
			-eq, -ne, -gt, -lt, =, !=, -z, -n, -e, -f, -d, -x
			nums: [ 2 -eq 2], [ 2 -ne 3]
			str: [ $a = $b ], [ $a != $b ], [ -z $a ], [ -e $a ]
			filesys: [ -e/-f/-d/-x path/to/file ]
		- do not forget the spaces after [ and befor ]!

• Ternary operator: -> statement ? IfTrue : IFFalse
	- syntax: comandA && commandB || commandC

	example: [ -f /path/to/fire.sh ] && echo true || echo false

• If statement:
	- syntax:
		if [ test-expression1 ];then
			commands
		elif [ test-expression2 ];then
			commands
		.
		.
		.
		
		elif [ test-expression ];then
			commands
		else
			commands
		fi

	- you can chain test-expression using command chaining list operators:
		if [ test-expression1 ] ||/&& [ test-expression2 ];then

• Case statement:
	- syntax:
		case "$variable" in
		pattern1)
			commands;;
		pattern2)
			commands;;
		.
		.
		.
		patternN)
			commands;;
		*)
			commands;;
		esac

Loop Through:
-------------

• until
    - sytax:
        until condition(s); do
            commands;
        done
    - execute commands as long as condition(s) has an exit status which is not zero.
    - condition can be test commands -> [ test commands ].

• While loop:
	- syntax:
		while condition(s); do
			commands;
		done
	- condition can be test commands -> [ test commands ].
	- to avoid infinite loops you must ensure that the condition does become false at some point.
	- usually used together with getopts or read command for condition statement.

• For loop: -> iterate over a list of elements
	- syntax:
		for variable in elem1 elem2 ... elemN; do
			commands;
		done
    - also supported form:
        for ((expr1 ; expr2; ... ; exprN)); do
        	commands;
		done

!!!break and continue missing!!!
