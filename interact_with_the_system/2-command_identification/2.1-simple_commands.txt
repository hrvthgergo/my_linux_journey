about commands
--------------

following tokenization shell takes the next step to process the input. this step is called command identification.
during command identification the shell parses tokens into simple and compound commands.
we groupped this huge topic into two blocks:
    2.1) the first one contains the following terms; simple commands, pipelines and lists of commands.
    2.2) the second one contains the following terms; reserved words, compound commands such as: user inputs, conditions, loops and groups.

---------------
simple commands
---------------

simple commands are a set of words terminated by a control operator. the first word is the command name, subsequent words are taken as individual arguments (options and their values) to that command.

---------
pipelines
---------        

a pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of | or |& control operators.
            form: [time [-p]] [!] command1 [ | or |& command2 ] …
            pipeing is a method to cennect standart data streams (see at 5-redirection) as the output of each command in the pipeline is connected via a pipe to the input of the next command.
            if ‘|&’ is used, command1’s standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to command2’s standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |. 
            !!but careful as redirection is the last processing step within the interact!!!

-----------------
lists of commands
-----------------

lists of commands consist of pipelines, actually in bash list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators: ‘;’, ‘&’, ‘&&’, or ‘||’.
            - '&': command1&command2 is going to run async,
	        - ';': command1;command2 is going to run linear,
	        - '&&': command1&&command2 and operator, command2 run only if command1 was successful (exit status 0),
	        - '||': command1||command2 or operator, command2 run only of command1 was unsuccessful (non-zero exit status).
            order of precedence: 1-(&&, ||), 2-(;,&)
